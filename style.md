# Personal Style

Quoting from [How to Establish a Personal Photographic Style by Alain Briot](https://luminous-landscape.com/how-to-establish-a-personal-photographic-style/)

* Developing a personal style is finding who you are and making your work be the extension of your personality.
* Subject is what you photograph, style is how you photograph it.
* Style is not genre (genre defines how you look at your subject from the perspective of the art movement you embrace).
* Personal discovery is not personal style.
* A personal style is a combination of choices (eg. equipment, approach, subject, light quality, composition).
* A personal style is fine tuning choices to fit your own personality.
* A personal style is not just about capturing facts. It is also about expressing emotions.
